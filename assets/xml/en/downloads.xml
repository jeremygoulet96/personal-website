                When the 2016 MacBook Pro was announced, despite the fact that I couldn't afford it at the moment, I wanted to have it immediately. So I jumped in Sketch and made my own device — in vector. If you like it, don't hesitate to share! For commercial use, just ask me!

                People say that I am a tidy person. I admit it, I like it when everything is in its own place. That's why I designed this fully editable folder icon pack in Sketch. You too can now make your own folder and use it to sort you files! If you like it, don't hesitate to share! For commercial use, just ask me!
