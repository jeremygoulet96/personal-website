The project was to create a responsive website for a music festival in Quebec City. We were in a team of two students. We only had access to a database of texts, as well as an image bank. The rest had to come from our imagination. I did the entire design of the website. Integration and programming were done in a team. The somewhat brutal design wanted to demonstrate the diversified face of the Quebec music festival. I wanted to draw attention, a bit like the lights on a stage.
