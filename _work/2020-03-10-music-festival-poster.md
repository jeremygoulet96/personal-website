In this project, I made the composition of a poster from a music festival. The goals were to expressively transpose the musical style and atmosphere of the festival and then organize and prioritize clearly and precisely the information associated with it.

The poster had to be 22 X 34 inches for printing in up to 4 colors. Although I have integrated other forms of graphic elements (shapes, images, lines, textures, patterns, etc.), it is first of all through the work of the typographic form and its different variables (body, weight, width, width, line spacing, line spacing, etc.) that the graphic system of the poster was constructed. In order to organize the different levels of information, I had to use different typographic organization systems (axial, bilateral, radial, circular, directional, modular and random).

The poster was primarily created in Illustrator, then finalized in Photoshop.

The final solution will have to combine reading comfort (readability), the expression of the theme and the visual impact specific to the poster format.

Goals
• Master different concepts and typographical variables in the context of the visual impact of the poster format.
• Master the composition of poster content using different types of typographic organization systems.
• Develop different graphic systems having a balance and consistency between the functional aspect of the object and the expression of the theme studied.
• Develop versatility and originality in his research methodology and in all of his compositions.
