The project was to create an interactive quiz based on Service Workers on the subject of our choice. The quiz had to be accessible for everyone, with a certain focus on keyboard controls. It was also necessary that the quiz be readable by a screen reader. The project had to be as light as possible because users could install it on their mobile devices through Service Workers.

That's why I used the WebP image format which is up to 26% smaller compared to PNG and JPEG.
